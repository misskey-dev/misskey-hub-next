# Online Status

A user's **Online Status** shows their current activity on Misskey.
It is displayed as an indicator in the corner of the user's icon on the user page.

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>🔴Red</td>
		<td>Offline</td>

Online status changes automatically and cannot be set manually.
You can, however, choose to make your online status to private.

:::warning

Some features, such as user recommendations, may use online status. Making your status private may make it harder for other users to find you.

# Notes

Notes are the main content of Misskey. They can consist of images, texts, polls, and more.On other platforms, notes are known as posts.

:::tip

The name "note" comes from the ActivityPub object type `Note`, which in this context "Represents a short written work typically less than a single paragraph in length."

:::

Once a note is created, it will be added to your [timeline](./timeline) and visible to your [followers](./follow) and other users on your instance.

You can [react](./reaction),reply, or quote notes.

You can find a note later by adding it to your [Favorites](./favorite)

## Renote

The act of quoting an existing note, sharing an existing note, or the note created as a result of these acts are all called Renote (or "renoting" as verb).
Most of the time, this is used when you want to share a note you like to your own followers, or when you want a share a note that you posted in the past once more.
While it is possible to renote the same note multiple times, please be aware that doing so may be seen as annoying by others.

:::warning

If you've set your note's visibility to Followers-only or Direct, then renoting it will not be possible.

:::

To remove a renote in Misskey Web, press "..." next to the renote time display next to the time display of the renote and select "Unrenote".

## CW

An abbreviation of "Content Warning", resulting in the content of a note being hidden unless explicitly requested to be shown by a viewing user.It is mainly used to hide the content of long notes or to prevent posting spoilers publicly.
To enable Cw for a note, press the "Hide content" button (eye icon) in the post form.By doing so a new text input area will appear, where you can write a summary of the content hidden by the CW.

## Visibility

For each note, you can set the range within which the note will be made public.
To set visibility in Misskey Web, click the icon to the left of the "Note" button on the compose form.
There are the following types of visibility:

question: I got a message from an account claiming to be Misskey or server support

The Misskey Project will never send these sorts of messages.This is likely a spam message. Contact your server administrator for more information.\*\*

If you receive an unexpected note from an account claiming to be Misskey, the Misskey Project, or the helpdesk for your instance or server claiming that "Your account is currently suspended" along with a link to an unfamiliar site, or if there are instructions asking you to take action urgently, such as responding to a mention, then it is likely spam.\*\*

If you receive these sorts of messages, contact your server admin first.**Opening links in these notes or replying to these notes can be dangerous.**\*\*

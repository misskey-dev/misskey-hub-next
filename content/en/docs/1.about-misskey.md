# About Misskey

Misskey is an open-source and distributed platform for microblogging.
Development was started in 2014 by syuilo in Japan.
It is characterized by its rich functionality, including drive and reaction, as well as a highly customizable UI.

## History

While Misskey started centered around Bulletin Boards as its main feature, the growth in popularity due to the addition of a timeline that let users post short messages and view them in chronological order lead to a gradual shift in the main focus of development towards this kind of functionality.
Misskey was not always a decentralized service, but became decentralized through the adoption of ActivityPub in 2018. Since then, it has become a service that is acknowledged and used by many.

:::tip

The name "Misskey" comes from a song called "Brain Diver" by a band that syuilo used to listen to at the time called May'n.

With anyone being able to join its development, Misskey is still continually being actively developed.

## What does "Decentralized" mean?

A <b>distributed</b> service, also called a <b>decentralized</b> service, refers to a service that divides its community into many servers (instances) that all mutually <b>communicate (federate)</b> with each other to share their contents, forming a <b>network (Fediverse)</b>.
Services that only have one instance or multiple instances that are independent of each other are called centralized. Most services fall under the category of centralized, some examples being Twitter (X) and Facebook.
The advantages of decentralized services include being able to freely choose the instance whose administration and theme suit you best. It's also possible for you to make your own server. Thanks to the federated nature, you will be able to access the same communities, no matter which server you choose.

## Always Open-Source

Misskey has always been, and will always be, open source.Open source simply means <b>that the source code of the software (a program) is publicly available</b>.This also includes being able to adjust or redistribute the source code in its definition.
The entirety of Misskey's source code is [published](https://github.com/misskey-dev) under an open-source license called [AGPL](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/blob/develop/LICENSE), which means anyone can freely inspect, use, adjust, change or redistribute as they see fit.
Open source has many merits, including allowing anyone being able to make changes as they like, to make sure the code does not include any harmful components and being able to easily participate in its development.
For realizing the distributed nature of Misskey, this concept of open source is indispensable.
Using the same example as before, most profit-oriented services like Twitter, Facebook etc. are not open source.

Technically speaking, Misskey's source code is managed via Git, and the repository is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/misskey-dev).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is this project aiming to achieve?

Unlike other platforms, Misskey is not grounded in a specific idea (for example, anti-centralization) or vision and being developed with that in mind, so it's a bit "aimless" in this respect.

<!-- TODO: ここにロードマップへのリンク -->

### Is Misskey being developed by a company?

No. Misskey is developed by individuals and not commercialized through connection with any particular company.
Development members are generally volunteers.
Additionally, while there are some corporate sponsors, development is still centered around the community.

### Who is managing Misskey?

Due to the decentralized nature of Misskey, each individual server has their own administration.Therefore, not all of Misskey is managed by one individual person or company.To put it bluntly, while this is a bit vague, Misskey is aiming to be a widely-used all-purpose platform. On the other hand though, this creates a flexibility due to not being bound by a specific direction to go towards. Development members are generally volunteers. Additionally, while there are some corporate sponsors, development is still centered around the community. This means that, as the development team does not control individual servers, for management-related questions you should contact your server's administration instead.

### Which server should I choose?

[A list of servers is available here.](/servers/)
Depending on the server, its community or central theme (for example, liking a show) may vary, so if there is a server that suits your interests, joining it would likely be a good choice.
Besides that, server size, userbase, country or spoken language, reliance or trust in the administration team and many other things can also serve as criteria.
There is however no single server that serves as the official server of Misskey.You also have the choice of creating a new server of your own.

Generally speaking, no matter which server you join, you will still be able to connect with users from all other servers.

### How can I create my own server?

Thank you for your interest in creating a Misskey server.\
To create a Misskey server, you can use dedicated services or semi-automated methods to set up the environment (of course, it is also possible to manually build the server).Please refer to [this document](/docs/for-admin/install/guides/) for more information.

### What kind of technology does Misskey use?

As Misskey's development progressed, the technologies used have changed significantly. In the beginning, it used a combination of MySQL + PHP + jQuery, but currently uses the following:

- Server-side: Node.js
- Database: PostgreSQL, Redis
- UI Framework: Vue.js
- Programming language: TypeScript

In addition to this, from Misskey derived technology such as MFM or AiScript are also being used.

### Is this a fork of Mastodon?

No.Misskey is a project completely different from Mastodon or other alike projects.
It has been in development for a long time already.However, it only became a decentralized network after the appearance of Mastodon. Besides both projects implementing the ActivityPub protocol, there is no relation between the two.

### Are there any apps for iOS / Android available?

We do not officially develop native apps for those operating systems, but there are several third-party apps available. Please see [here](/docs/for-users/resources/apps/) for more information.

However, third-party applications will inevitably lag behind the official Web client in functionality, so unless you really want to use a native application, we recommend the official Web client instead.
As the Misskey Web client supports PWA, you can use it as if it was a native application.

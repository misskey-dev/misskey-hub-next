# Misskey Extensions to ActivityPub

This page documents the extensions to ActivityPub that Misskey uses. This page lists some context items defined in JSON-LD contexts and explains their semantics.

This document uses [compact IRIs](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#dfn-compact-iri).
The prefix `ap` is used to refer to `https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#`.
The prefix `misskey` is used to refer to `https://misskey-hub.net/ns#`.

## `_misskey_content`

- compact IRI: `misskey:_misskey_content`
- canonical IRI: `https://misskey-hub.net/ns#_misskey_content`

:::warning

This value is deprecated and might be removed in the future.
See also <https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/pull/8787>.

:::

This value is identical to having a `source` property like this:

```js
source: {
	content: _misskey_content,
	mediaType: "text/x.misskeymarkdown"
}
```

Where `_misskey_content` represents the value of the field described in this section.

## `_misskey_summary`

- compact IRI: `misskey:_misskey_summary`
- canonical IRI: `https://misskey-hub.net/ns#_misskey_summary`

Used on actors to display their summary as MFM. The content is same as `summary`, but in MFM form.

## `_misskey_quote`

- compact IRI: `misskey:_misskey_quote`
- canonical IRI: `https://misskey-hub.net/ns#_misskey_quote`

:::tip

Ways to potentially provide this information using the core ActivityPub vocabulary are currently underway, see <https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/issues/8722>.

:::

Indicates that this note is quoting another note. It contains the `id` of the note being quoted.

This seems to be identical to `https://fedibird.com/ns#quoteUri`.
Misskey also uses `as:quoteUrl` for this but this was not adopted to the ActivityPub specification.
This is for compatibility with some other ActivityPub programs that operate using this.

## `_misskey_reaction`

- compact IRI: `misskey:_misskey_reaction`
- canonical IRI: `https://misskey-hub.net/ns#_misskey_reaction`

Misskey federates its reactions as `Like` activities.
What kind of reaction was used is conveyed using this field.
Misskey also sets `ap:content` of the `Like` activity to the same value.

The content will be a string that either contains a single Unicode Emoji or a string that starts and ends with a colon. In the latter case the reaction uses a custom emoji, and the `tag` property will be set to contain the data of the respective emoji.

## `_misskey_votes`

- compact IRI: `misskey:_misskey_votes`
- canonical IRI: `https://misskey-hub.net/ns#_misskey_votes`

This value is used for `Question` activities to indicate the number of votes an option currently has.
This value is identical to having a `replies` property like this:

```js
replies: {
	type: 'Collection',
	totalItems: _misskey_votes
}
```

Where `_misskey_votes` represents the value of the field described in this section.

## `_misskey_talk`

- compact IRI: `misskey:_misskey_talk`
- canonical IRI: `https://misskey-hub.net/ns#_misskey_talk`

This value is used for `Note` type objects to indicate that they are a Misskey chat message.
Misskey handles these kinds of messages specially, e.g. it will apply different audience scoping rules and show them via a different API than usual `Note` objects.

This field can only take the value of `true` (or be absent).

## `isCat`

- compact IRI: `misskey:isCat`
- canonical IRI: `https://misskey-hub.net/ns#isCat`

Used on actors to indicate that they in some way identify as a cat, expressed as a boolean value.
If this property is set to `true`, displaying the actor or their notes will have some special effects attached in some clients.

## `_misskey_followedMessage`
- compact IRI: `misskey:_misskey_followedMessage`
- canonical IRI: `https://misskey-hub.net/ns#_misskey_followedMessage`

This value is used for `Actor` type objects to show message on followed.

This property must be either `null` or a string if existent.
The value is customized message. In other word, it can be set arbitrary by an account.

Misskey shows the value on notification to new followee when:
- The property is set,
- value is a string,
- the followee's Misskey is 2024.9.0-alpha.11 or later,
- and one who has set this property gets followed by the followee

## `_misskey_requireSigninToViewContents`
(introduced in: https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/pull/14799)

- compact IRI: `misskey:_misskey_requireSigninToViewContents`
- canonical IRI: `https://misskey-hub.net/ns#_misskey_requireSigninToViewContents`

This property is used for `Actor` type object to forbid show one's content when viewer is not signed-in.
This value must be either `true` or `false` if existent.

An implementation should refuse to show their content to align to Misskey's implementation if the value is `true` and the viewer is not signed-in.

This property is not guaranteed to work on older Misskey or non-Misskey implementation.

## `_misskey_makeNotesFollowersOnlyBefore`
(introduced in: https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/pull/14814)

- compact IRI: `misskey:_misskey_makeNotesFollowersOnlyBefore`
- canonical IRI: `https://misskey-hub.net/ns#_misskey_makeNotesFollowersOnlyBefore`

This property is used for `Actor` type object to forbid show one's *past* content when viewer is not a follower of author.
This value must be a integer if existent.

Misskey computes that the threshold of the Unix epoch millisecond in the either way:
- If the value is positive, then the value is interpreted as an absolute Unix epoch millisecond.
- If the value is negative, then the value is relative millisecond compared to posted date. For example, `-86400000` implies targeting a note that has posted before yesterday because a day contains 86400 seconds.

If posted date is considered as older than the threshold, then it is considered as a past content. 
If the viewer is not a follower of the author, then past content shall not be shown.

This property is not guaranteed to work on older Misskey or non-Misskey implementation.

## `_misskey_makeNotesHiddenBefore`
(introduced in: https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/pull/14814)

- compact IRI: `misskey:_misskey_makeNotesHiddenBefore`
- canonical IRI: `https://misskey-hub.net/ns#_misskey_makeNotesHiddenBefore`

This property is used for `Actor` type object. This property has same semantics and value range as `_misskey_makeNotesFollowersOnlyBefore` but affected viewer: the value affects everyone but author themselves.

This property is not guaranteed to work on older Misskey or non-Misskey implementation.

## `_misskey_license`

- compact IRI: `misskey:_misskey_license`
- canonical IRI: `https://misskey-hub.net/ns#_misskey_license`

This property is used to express licenses about each `Emoji` objects.
This property may not exist due to following reasons:

- The source server do not follow this extension, or
- The source server uses old Misskey version

This property has the following known properties:

- `freeText`: The value is either string or null. This field MUST present. Implies Sender did not set explicit license if the value is null.
  This SHOULD NOT be empty string because it is nonsense; Proper way to declare that the Emoji object has not set explicit license is setting null on this property.
  Describes how usage is permitted from its author in non-machine-friendly free-form text.
  The language, format, wording, or containing information in the value is not specified; Receivers SHOULD NOT assume it's written in some specific manner.

Source servers SHOULD NOT set properties in other way that differs in above description except in the case of keeping backwards compatibility.

Source servers SHOULD NOT set unknown properties except in the case of keeping backwards compatibility, because more property may be added in the future.

Recipient servers SHOULD ignore unknown properties.

## `_misskey_channel`

- compact IRI: `misskey:_misskey_channel`
- canonical IRI: `https://misskey-hub.net/ns#_misskey_channel`

This property is used to express channels where `Note` object is originally posted, or to express a place where the channel is located in a `Application` object.
This property may not exist because the Source server do not include property due to reasons, i.e. the server does not support this extension.

If property exists, its value MUST conform to following definitions:

### As in `Note` object
This property has following known sub-properties. Each property MUST exist unless noted as *optional*.

- `url`: An URL that refers original channel's top page. Example value: `https://misskey.example/channel/abcdefghijklmnopq`
- `name`: A free-form channel's name. Example value: `Base Forum of example server`
- `description`: A free-form channel's description. Example value: `This channel is used to request something to the admin.`
- `isSensitive`: Indicates whether channel is marked as "sensitive". Value MUST be either `true` or `false`. Example value: `false`.
  - If this property is true, Misskey treats effective Visibility of this Note as "Home", like "Send to Home" operation. This means every Viewer cannot chain (including Renote, Reply, and Quote) other Act as "Public" Visibility.
- `follower`: **Reserved**. Any implementor MUST NOT contain this property. Recipient servers MUST ignore this properties if exist.

Note: it does not contain a definition of `follower` because who followed the channel is invisible unless the Viewer is server admin. This is not a case if the Note is delivered to the remote.

### As in `Application` object

- `url`: An URL that refers original channel's top page. This MAY be different from `Application.url` because Application property wants to point the subject as "System User". Example value: `https://misskey.example/channel/abcdefghijklmnopq`
- `isSensitive`: Indicates whether channel is marked as "sensitive". Value MUST be either `true` or `false`. Example value: `false`.
  - If this property is true, Misskey treats effective "Visibility" of every notes from this channel as "Home", like "Silence" operation. This means every Viewer cannot chain (including Renote, Reply, and Quote) other Act as "Public" Visibility.
- `allowRenoteToExternal`: Indicates whether note can be renoted outside of "channel context". The value MUST be either `true` or `false`.
  - If this property is false, the Recipient server MUST NOT allow that the contained note to be renoted or quoted outside of "channel context".

#### Happened effect on suspend

*This section is non-normative.*

When a Recipient server suspends "System User" that has some `_misskey_channel` definition, it makes the Recipient server to reject every Notes from the channel.

#### Happened effect on silence

*This section is non-normative.*

When a Recipient server silences "System User" that has some `_misskey_channel` definition, it makes the Recipient server to set effective "Visibility" to "Home" instead of "Public" until the Recipient server do un-silence.

### Any other object
No specified behavior is defined.

## Reactions to Remote Posts

Reactions are a feature original to Misskey. Platforms that do not support Misskey reactions will receive the reaction as a "like" activity.This might be called a "favourite" on some platforms.

## Reactions from Remote Instances

If a generic "like" activity is received from a remote server, Misskey will interpret it as a "❤" reaction.

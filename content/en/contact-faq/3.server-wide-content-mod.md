The Misskey Project is an organization that develops Misskey, but does not provide any Misskey server-related services. Therefore, **if you contact us via the form below, we are unable to address your request.**

This is the official website for Misskey, the open source SNS server software developed by Misskey Project.

Misskey is server software for operating SNS services. It is not itself an SNS service.

Note that SNS services using Misskey software (Misskey servers) are sometimes referred to as "Misskey".)

The Misskey Project is only responsible for the source code of the Misskey server software, which is provided free-of-charge. We do not provide or operate any servers that use Misskey software or its derivatives.

We also do not have the ability to regulate services using Misskey software.

We are unable to respond to inquiries on our contact form about individual servers.\*\*

Content moderation on individual servers is conducted according to the rules of each server. If you wish to have content removed, please contact the administrator of the server where the content originated, or you can block the user or server as a self-defense measure.

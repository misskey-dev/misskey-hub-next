# Mutes and Blocks

If you don't like someone, you can mute them so they're no longer visible to you. Or, as a more powerful measure, you can block someone so they can't see your content or interact with you. The other person won't know that they are muted, but they will know that they are blocked.It is up to you to decide which one to use.

:::tip

Mutes and blocks can be used together.

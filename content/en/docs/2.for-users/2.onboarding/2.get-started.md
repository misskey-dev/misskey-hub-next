# Find a Misskey Server

Misskey is a software and a project.
The server running Misskey, which is publicly available on the Internet is called a **Server**.
To use Misskey, you create an account on one of these servers and use that server.

You can choose any server from the [server list](/servers/).

No matter which server you choose, you can interact with users on other servers.

Misskey has federated functionality.

This federated functionality allows users on different servers to follow, react, and renote in the same way as users on the same server, even if they are on different servers.

The federated functionality that Misskey incorporates is based on an open common standard called ActivityPub and is compatible with other software such as Mastodon and Pleroma.

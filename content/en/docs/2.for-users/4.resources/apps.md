# Apps

Here are some applications to use Misskey.

When you log in to a Misskey server from your browser, you will see a timeline.What you see in this case is Misskey Web, Misskey's only official client.It is a browser-based application which also supports PWA, so it can be run like a native mobile OS application.For more information, please click [here](/docs/for-users/stepped-guides/how-to-use-pwa/).Please note that the Misskey project does not develop native apps.

Once you get used to Misskey Web, you may want to try unofficial apps developed by volunteers.Here are the most widely used apps (in alphabetical order).

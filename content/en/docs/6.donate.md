Misskey is not a business, and stays free to use by receiving its earnings through donations from everyone.(Some servers may be like advertising revenue, but that is the income of the administrator and not directly goes to the developer.)
Your donation will help us to continue development, and it is your contribution to the project.

**The badge will not be applied automatically and you will not automatically appear in Misskey credit, so if you would like to receive the privilege, please send a request to `@syuilo@misskey.io` with proof of your donation.**

(If you don't receive a response after some time, please tag us again as we may be overwhelmed with many inquiries.Also, please note that we may not reach you from server other than misskey.io.If you are unable to reach us, please contact us using the Misskey Project Contact Form.)

:::

In addition to this, server administrators are also generally speaking not earning revenue.As operating a server costs money, please also consider supporting your server's administrator.

This does not have a direct relation to the development of Misskey, but the existence of servers is what makes up the project, meaning the continued existence of servers is just about as important as that of the project itself.

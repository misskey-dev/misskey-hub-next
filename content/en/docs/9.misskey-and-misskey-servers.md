# Misskey vs Misskey Servers

Misskey is not the same as a Misskey _server_ (Misskey instance).

However, because the Misskey software and Misskey servers are **both colloquially referred to as Misskey**, they are often confused for one another.</b>

実際に、「Misskeyサーバー」のことを誤って「Misskey」と認識した上でのお問い合わせも多くあります。
(MisskeyはMisskeyサーバーの運営ではありません。また、当Webサイトは「Misskey」の公式Webサイトであり、「Misskeyサーバー」のWebサイトではありません)

Please make sure that you are not confusing the two.

## Misskey (the Software)

Misskey is **free and open source software for hosting social networking services (SNS)** developed by the Misskey Project.

Open source means that the software's source code (blueprint) is available to the public. Free means that there is no charge for using the source code (free as in beer), and that the source code can be used however you wish (free as in libre).

Misskeyが「SNS」として紹介されることがありますが、それは誤りです。

あくまでも「Webサービスを作るためのソフトウェア」であり、登録やログインを行う「Webサービスそのもの」ではありません。

:::tip

そのため、サービスとしての「Misskey運営」というものも存在しません。

登録やログインを行った経験があるのであれば、それはMisskeyではなくMisskeyサーバーになります。

:::

:::warning

スパムアカウントが「Misskey運営」「Misskeyサポート」などを名乗っている場合があります。

前述のようにそのような組織・窓口はそもそも存在しません。

:::

Because anybody can freely use the Misskey source code, many people have started SNS services (Misskey servers) on the web using Misskey.

Additionally, anyone can participate in developing Misskey.

## Misskey Servers

A Misskey server refers to an **SNS service built using the Misskey software.**

For example, websites like Misskey.io, Misskey.design, and Nijimiss.moe are all Misskey servers (or Misskey-based servers).

Note that Misskey servers are built on top of other software, not just Misskey itself, including database software like PostgreSQL and Redis, and web server software like Nginx.

Misskeyサーバーの数は2025年現在、少なくとも1,000サーバー以上確認されています。

Servers can be operated by individuals or by an organization.

:::tip

Operators, policies, and terms of service can vary depending on server.

The Misskey Project (the developer of the Misskey software) does not operate any Misskey servers, and does not have the authority to manage or administer individual Misskey servers, nor intervene in their operation.

Features such as custom emojis, roles, advertisements, and word filters are not hard coded into Misskey. Rather, the administrators of individual servers configure these features themselves.

:::

n.b. As mentioned before, both Misskey and individual servers are commonly referred to as Misskey. When someone mentions Misskey, they may actually be referring to an individual server.ご注意ください。

The Misskey logo, icon, or the text "Powered by Misskey" may appear on a server to indicate it was created using Misskey.

### Misskey-based Servers

Servers created using software derived from Misskey, rather than Misskey itself, are referred to as Misskey-based servers.

Misskey-based servers might simply be called "Misskey servers".

When a server calls itself a "Misskey server", it is possible that the server is actually running a fork of Misskey, meaning it is not using the original Misskey software.

## The Misskey Project

The Misskey Project is the community of volunteers developing the Misskey software.

## Analogies

### Websites

Misskey is similar to Wordpress, software for creating websites.

A Misskey server is analogous to a website created using Wordpress.

### Apartments

Misskey is analogous to the blueprint of an apartment building, whereas a Misskey server is the constructed building.

The Misskey Project is the architectural firm that creates the blueprint for the apartment, while Misskey users are tenants of the apartment building.

Just as different apartment buildings can have different landlords (and building managers), each Misskey server can have different administrators (and moderators).

The Misskey Project is only responsible for the building blueprints; it does not build apartments using the blueprints, it is not a landlord or building management company, nor can it help manage any apartment buildings.

#### Updates

The blueprints for the apartment building are continuously revised and improved, and new features (like a fire escape) are incorporated.

However, just because the blueprints have been revised, doesn't mean that the apartment building has changed.

To keep the apartment building up to date with the latest blueprints, the landlord needs to conduct regular renovations.

The frequency of renovations in an apartment building depends on the landlord, so the currency of an apartment building will vary from building to building.

#### Support

Only the landlord can handle issues like neighbor disputes and problems with the building facilities.

The Misskey Project is merely an architecture firm and cannot assist with issues regarding the apartment building.

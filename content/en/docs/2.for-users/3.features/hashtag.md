# Hashtags

Hashtag is a feature that allows you to add searchable tags to your posts.

The world's first hashtag, #barcamp, was created by Chris Messina [@chrismessina@mastodon.xyz](https://mastodon.xyz/@chrismessina) on [August 24, 2007 at 4:25 AM](https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/223115412?lang=en).Later, this idea of using the pound sign `#` to make searches easier was reborn as "hashtag," a word coined by combining the English word "hash," meaning "to chop up or shred," and "tag," meaning "label," and was officially adopted by Twitter at the time.Incidentally, Chris Messina chose `#` because it was reminiscent of IRC channel names starting with `#`.

The way to use hashtags in the Fediverse is slightly different from how it is used in centralized services such as X and Instagram.In the Fediverse, full-text search is sometimes difficult, making it hard to find a specific post, but if a post contains a hashtag, you can easily locate it by following the hashtag.Additionally, there are services on the Fediverse called hashtag relays that automatically send posts to various sites just by adding hashtags to them, so hashtags are quite important.
